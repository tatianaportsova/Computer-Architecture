CALL and RET
------------

Subroutines
    Functions, but you can't pass anything in
    And they can't return anything


def foo():
    print("foo 1")

    return

def bar():
    print("bar 1")
    foo()
    print("bar 2") # addr_2

    return

print("main 1")
bar()
print("main 2")  # addr_1 <-- PC

Stack: <- top

CALL:
    push return address on stack
    set pc to address of subroutine

RET:
    pop return addr off top of stack
    set the pc to the return address
